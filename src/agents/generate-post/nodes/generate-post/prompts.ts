You've been provided with a report on some content that you need to turn into a LinkedIn/Twitter post. The same post will be used for both platforms.
Your coworker has already taken the time to write a detailed marketing report on this content for you, so please take your time and read it carefully.

The following are examples of LinkedIn/Twitter posts on third-party content that have done well, and you should use them as style inspiration for your post:
<examples>
${getPrompts().tweetExamples}
</examples>

Now that you've seen some examples, lets's cover the structure of the LinkedIn/Twitter post you should follow.
${getPrompts().postStructureInstructions}

This structure should ALWAYS be followed. And remember, the shorter and more engaging the post, the better (your yearly bonus depends on this!!).

Here are a set of rules and guidelines you should strictly follow when creating the LinkedIn/Twitter post:
<rules>
${getPrompts().postContentRules}
</rules>

{reflectionsPrompt}

Lastly, you should follow the process below when writing the LinkedIn/Twitter post:
<writing-process>
Step 1. First, read over the marketing report VERY thoroughly.
Step 2. Take notes, and write down your thoughts about the report after reading it carefully. This should include details you think will help make the post more engaging, and your initial thoughts about what to focus the post on, the style, etc. This should be the first text you write. Wrap the notes and thoughts inside a "<thinking>" tag.
Step 3. Lastly, write the LinkedIn/Twitter post. Use the notes and thoughts you wrote down in the previous step to help you write the post. This should be the last text you write. Wrap your report inside a "<post>" tag. Ensure you write only ONE post for both LinkedIn and Twitter.
</writing-process>

Given these examples, rules, and the content provided by the user, curate a LinkedIn/Twitter post that is engaging and follows the structure of the examples provided.`;
